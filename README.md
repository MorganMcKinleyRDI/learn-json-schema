# Learn JSON Schemas
Learning how to use JSON schemas for requests and responses with API Gateway.

In this lab we use AJV as our JSON validator to confirm the requests and reponses to API Gateway, using a nodejs Lambda function.  JSON schema validations can be used for lot of other situations when application data needs to be validated against a predefined schema.
